## key insights

--1. Customer Insights

--Scale & composition: ~6,000 customers; balanced gender mix with three age segments (Teenager / Adult / Senior).

--Engagement: ~50% of customers are currently active — a reasonable base but with clear upside by reactivating inactive users.


--2. Restaurant & Product Performance

--Top performers: A few brands (Subway, KFC, Pizza Hut, Burger King, McDonald’s) generate the majority of revenue.

--Top dishes: Pasta and sandwich appear among top-selling items — useful for promotions and cross-sell bundles.

--Underperformers: Some restaurants/cuisines show lower revenue but higher cancellation or delay rates.

--3. Order & Delivery Performance

--Delivery issues: Noticeable proportion of ‘Delayed’ and ‘Cancelled’ orders concentrated in particular restaurants and cities. Delays also correlate with lower ratings.

--Business implication: Prioritize reducing cancellations in high-volume restaurants and consider incentives for prepaid payments to reduce COD risk
